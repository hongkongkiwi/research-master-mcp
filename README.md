## Overview

Research Master MCP is a comprehensive academic research server that provides unified access to **28 major research repositories and databases**. It implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to integrate seamlessly with AI assistants like Claude Desktop, enabling powerful literature search, paper discovery, and citation analysis capabilities.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew tap hongkongkiwi/research-master-mcp
brew install research-master-mcp
```

**Other methods:** See [Installation](docs/installation.md) for Linux packages, Docker, and building from source.

### 2. Configure Your MCP Client

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "research-master": {
      "command": "research-master-mcp",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

See [MCP Clients](docs/mcp-clients.md) for setup instructions for Claude Desktop, Zed, Cursor, Continue, and 15+ other clients.

### 3. Start Searching

Once configured, use natural language with your AI assistant:

```
Search for papers about "transformer architecture" from 2020 onwards
Download the paper 1706.03762 and find what papers cite it
Find papers by Geoffrey Hinton on deep learning
```

See [Tools](docs/tools.md) for all available MCP tools.

## Features

- **28 Research Sources**: arXiv, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, PubMed, PMC, bioRxiv, and [more](docs/sources.md)
- **Unified Search**: Single query searches across all sources
- **Smart Source Detection**: Automatically identifies paper IDs (arXiv, PMC, DOI, etc.)
- **PDF Download**: Save papers to your local filesystem
- **Citation Analysis**: Find papers that cite or are cited by a paper
- **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate results across sources
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable to avoid API throttling

See [Sources](docs/sources.md) for supported databases, API requirements, and rate limits.
